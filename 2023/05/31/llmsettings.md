_Q1: What's the difference between temperature and top p?_

A: Temperature and top-p are two different methods used in large language models to generate text.

Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the generated text. A higher temperature value will result in more diverse and unpredictable text, while a lower temperature value will result in more conservative and predictable text.

On the other hand, top-p (or nucleus) sampling is a method that selects the most probable words from the model's output distribution, up to a certain probability threshold. This method ensures that the generated text is diverse but still coherent and relevant to the context.

In summary, temperature controls the randomness of the generated text, while top-p sampling controls the diversity and relevance of the generated text

_Q2: How do the presence penalty and frequency penalty affect model?_

Frequency penalty and presence penalty are two parameters used in language models, such as GPT-3, to control the diversity and repetition of generated text.

Frequency penalty is a value that is added to the log-probability of a token each time it occurs in the generated text. A higher frequency penalty value will discourage the model from repeating the same words or phrases too frequently within the generated text.

Presence penalty, on the other hand, is a one-time, additive contribution that applies to all tokens that have been sampled at least once. It does not consider how frequently a word has been used, but just if the word exists in the text. The presence penalty increases the likelihood that the model will talk about new topics.

In summary, frequency penalty is used to prevent word repetitions, while presence penalty is used to prevent topic repetitions
