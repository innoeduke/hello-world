## My thought today

### Why using VSCode Journal?

As a core merit, VSCode Journal enables me to use VSCode as **the** single editor for all editing tasks

### What about the Hello World repo @github?

- VSCode Journal is a good replacement of my hello world project.
- Or maybe I should figure out how to add this Journal folder to my hello world repo on github.
